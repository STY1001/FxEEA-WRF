# FxEEA-WRF
Remove the fucking EEA (DMA) restriction for some Windows Feature

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you know how annoying some stupid European laws (such as DMA, DCA or GDPR). And that's because of them that we Europeans don't get all the cool features available elsewhere around the world — or 5 years later when the feature is deprecated...

I don't say that all these laws are useless — sometimes they can be cool (for example, being able to uninstall Edge), but most of the time they're very restrictive and annoying.


## How to use it ?
1. Download the [`main.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STY1001/FxEEA-WRF/refs/heads/main/main.py) file
2. Install Python on you PC if you don't have it
3. Launch a command prompt and simply run `python main.py`
4. Reboot your PC and re enjoy being in the EEA
