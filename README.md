# FxEEA-WRF
Remove the fucking EEA (DMA) restriction for some Windows Feature

If you are in a EEA region, you know how is annying can be some European stupid law (like DMA, DCA or GDPR), this is why, here we don't have all cool features or 5 year later when the feature is deprecated

I don't say all this laws are useless, it can be cool sometime (for exemple, removable Edge) but, most of the time it's very restrictive and annoying


## How to use it ?
1. Download the [`main.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STY1001/FxEEA-WRF/refs/heads/main/main.py) file
2. Install Python on you PC if you don't have it
3. Launch a command prompt and simply run `python main.py`
4. Reboot your PC and re enjoy being in the EEA
